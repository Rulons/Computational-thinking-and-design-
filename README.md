## Pathfinding in a Grid-Based World

This repository contains my final project for the Computational Thinking and Design module. The goal of the program is to navigate a 2D grid using both manual controls and an autonomous pathfinding algorithm.

Features

Manual movement mode (W/A/S/D)

Automatic mode using the A* Pathfinding Algorithm

Terrain costs:

0 = ground

1 = blocked (mountain)

2 = lake (slower movement)

Animated path visualisation

## Note on earlier versions

Earlier versions of the project exist in this repository as part of the development process. The final solution is the modular version shown above.

## Running the project

Clone the repo

Run main.py in a Python environment

Choose either manual or automatic mode
